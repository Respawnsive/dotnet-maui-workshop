# .NET MAUI - Workshop - Community Modules - Apizr

This workshop is designed to learn the basics of "Apizr" library and how to use it in a .NET MAUI application.

We create this workshop on top of the final sources from the [Monkey Finder MAUI workshop](https://github.com/dotnet-presentations/dotnet-maui-workshop/)

If you didn't looked at this workshop yet, I strongly recommend you to do it first before starting this one.


## Languages
This workshop is available in the following languages:
* English - default README files

## Setup Guide

No specific setup is required for starting this Apizr workshop, if you already followed the [dotnet-presentations/dotnet-maui-workshop](https://github.com/dotnet-presentations/dotnet-maui-workshop/blob/main/README.md)

If you didn't follow the previous workshop just verify it's 'Setup Guide', it will help you to setup your environment for this Apizr workshop.

We also put together an abstract of what you can expect for the workshop:

* [Part 1](Part%201%20-%20Getting%20started/README.md) - Getting Started
